Born and raised on the small island of Manhattan, Neil grew up visiting museums and galleries across all neighborhoods. Although Neil spent most of his childhood developing athletically, he had a keen eye for art and detail that he often accredits to his Dyslexia. Being able to learn quicker through visualization than reading or listening, Neil found his way to art through travel. His travel opened the door to both digital and medium format photography and was his first real outlet for artistic expression. After studying Product Design at Stanford University, Neil developed manufacturing skills across multiple tools and materials and took to “making.” Trained alongside mechanical engineers, Neil has slowly begun to turn this craftsmanship into another artistic outlet — creating sculpture. In beginning to shape his artistic voice, Neil has developed pieces striving in two different directions. Some of his work is centered around geometric shapes and their ability to fill a space and awe a viewer, while a newer direction of his work tries to package American society into three dimensions. Problems in American society are a common underlying tone of his work but are never meant to be taken too seriously in the work. Neil feels that while it is extremely important to be aware of the United State’s issues as a way of avoiding becoming a part of them, it is also important to take the time to soak in the everydayness of our State and to not fear mediocrity or hypocrisy. Why don’t we celebrate the Big Mac’s deliciousness instead of faulting the obese? In both of Neil’s artistic voices his manufacturing methods stay close to home. Using only simple woodworking and metalworking processes, Neil avoids the extraneous work that comes with overly complicated tools and ideas.
